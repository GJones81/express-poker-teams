# Express Poker Teams

Let's have a class poker tournament!

## Prerequisites

Students will need to have had the following lessons before attempting this assignment:

* Intro to Sequelize
* One to many relationships
* RESTful routing in Express

## Getting started

* Fork and clone this repository
* Run `npm install` to install the dependencies in `package.json`
* Stop and take a moment to read through the existing code. You should have a simple express app with a wildcard route (a catch-all that renders an error page) and basic setup of express-ejs-layouts.
* Run `nodemon` and ensure you can access that error page at `localhost:3000`.
